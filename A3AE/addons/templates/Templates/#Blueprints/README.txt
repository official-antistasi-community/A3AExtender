## BLUEPRINT README ##

Please note that this blueprints do contain the basic definitions.
Nevertheless, when using them always make sure to check templates which are currently being used over at https://github.com/official-antistasi-community/A3-Antistasi/tree/unstable/A3A/addons/core/Templates

When using those templates, do make sure that you are adapting all names, references and such to ensure them working properly as well as readability.
